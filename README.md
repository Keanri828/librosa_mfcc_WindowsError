# librosaTest
## Description
I created this repository to share code and configurations of a small Python script that runs into the following error
trying to calculate the MFCC-values of an audio file. This error only occurs on Windows and Google Collab so far. It is
caused using the function `librosa.feature.mfcc`. For current information (that maybe is not mentioned here yet) please visit:

## Traceback
```
Traceback (most recent call last):

## \.yml file
If you are also interested in finding a solution, please consider using the Anaconda3-environment that can be created
using the yml-file. For information on how to create a conda environment based on a yml-file please visit:

## Information to audio directory
In this example script I used an audio file contained in RAVDESS (https://zenodo.org/record/1188976). This database
contains emotional audio and video data that can be used in (e.g.) affective computing research fields. The audio file
is not included in this git repository, because it's not relevant for the problem. Any audio or even video files (while
creating this example I found out by accident that librosa can also load from \*.mp4). The script
`mfcc_test_librosaAudioExample.py` can be runned without any download. It uses an example audio file provided by librosa.
